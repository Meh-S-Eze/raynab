## YNAB Authentication Flow in MCP

The authentication flow for your Raynab MCP would work as follows:

1. **Initial Interaction**: The user starts a conversation with Claude and expresses interest in managing their YNAB budget.

2. **Token Request**: Claude explains that authentication is needed and instructs the user to obtain a personal access token from the YNAB website:
   ```
   To access your YNAB data, I'll need your personal access token. You can generate one at https://app.youneedabudget.com/settings/developer
   ```

3. **Token Provision**: The user obtains and provides the token to Claude.

4. **Token Storage**: Claude calls the `authenticate` tool in your MCP implementation:
   ```typescript
   // Example of what happens behind the scenes
   await mcpClient.call('raynab', 'authenticate', { token: 'user-provided-token' });
   ```

5. **Token Validation**: Your MCP server validates the token with the YNAB API and stores it securely in a local configuration file or environment variable.

6. **Session Persistence**: For the duration of the session (or across sessions if implemented), your MCP server uses the stored token for all YNAB API calls without requiring re-authentication.

7. **Token Refresh**: If the token expires, Claude would detect the authentication error and prompt the user to provide a new token.

## Available Chat Interfaces for MCP

There are several options for chat interfaces that work with MCP:

### 1. Claude Desktop (Recommended)

Claude Desktop is the simplest option for integrating with your MCP:

- **Native MCP Support**: Claude Desktop has built-in support for MCP servers.
- **Configuration**: You'd configure Claude Desktop to connect to your Raynab MCP server through its config file:

```json
// ~/.claude/claude_desktop_config.json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "raynab": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["./dist/index.js"],
      "cwd": "/path/to/your/raynab-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

- **User Experience**: Users simply chat with Claude as normal, and when they mention YNAB or budgeting, Claude automatically knows to use your Raynab MCP.
- **No Additional Development**: This approach requires no additional chat interface development.

### 2. Claude Web/Mobile with uvx

Anthropic offers a tool called `uvx` that can package your MCP server for distribution:

- **Distribution**: Package your MCP as a standalone app that users can install.
- **Integration**: Users can then refer to your tool in Claude web or mobile apps.
- **Documentation**: Anthropic provides documentation for creating and distributing MCP tools this way.

### 3. Custom Web Interface

If you want complete control over the user experience:

- **Custom Development**: Build a web application with a chat interface.
- **Claude API Integration**: Integrate Anthropic's API to power the chat.
- **MCP Connection**: Your web app would need to either:
  - Run the MCP server in the background (for desktop web apps)
  - Connect to a hosted version of your MCP server (for cloud deployment)

```javascript
// Example front-end code (simplified)
async function sendMessage(userMessage) {
  const response = await fetch('https://your-api-endpoint.com/chat', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify({
      message: userMessage,
      tool_use: "raynab" // Signal to use Raynab MCP
    })
  });
  
  const data = await response.json();
  displayResponse(data.response);
}
```

## Recommendation

The simplest approach is to use Claude Desktop, as it:

1. Requires no additional chat interface development
2. Provides a seamless experience for users
3. Handles all the complexity of tool use behind the scenes

For users who don't have Claude Desktop, you could package your MCP with `uvx` for broader accessibility. This gives you the benefits of MCP without having to build your own chat interface from scratch.

If you do require a completely custom experience, building a web interface with Claude API integration is possible but would require significantly more development effort.
